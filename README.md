# ShellCodeRunner Example Code
XOR Payload Encryptor for .NET and Payload Runner with Built-in XOR Decryptor
## This is just an Example
This code is an example for running shell code on a Windows system via .NET assembly.  It consists of 2 projects:
##### 1. XORKryptor
- XOR encryptor that can be used on any file, but was written to as an example to encrypt Cobalt Strike payloads.
##### 2. ShellCodeRunner: Executing the shellcode injection technique
- Example code inteded for running XOR encrypted Cobal Strike payloads.  It contains a XOR decryptor which decrypts the payload before running.
## Special Thanks
This example code was made entirely possible by @djhohnstein<br />
He is a MOUNTAIN of knowledge and I learned a LOT!
